# Air-to-Air Detection Module

## Overview
Advanced detection system for identifying drones from UAV platforms, building on foundations from basic object detection and drone detection modules.

## Key Challenges
- **High-speed platforms**: Both observer and target moving at significant speeds
- **Small target size**: Drones appear as small objects in camera frames
- **Dynamic perspectives**: Constantly changing viewing angles and distances
- **Real-time constraints**: Must process detections within flight-critical timeframes

## Technical Implementation

### Data Requirements
- **Synthetic datasets**: Simulation-generated air-to-air scenarios
- **Real-world footage**: UAV-to-UAV detection scenarios
- **Annotated datasets**: Precise bounding boxes for small drone targets

### Model Architecture
- **Base detector**: YOLOv8 optimized for small objects
- **Temporal integration**: Multi-frame consistency checking
- **Post-processing**: Custom NMS for high-speed scenarios

### Key Files
- `detection_pipeline.py` - Main detection inference pipeline
- `data_preprocessing.py` - Data augmentation and preparation
- `model_training.py` - Training scripts for air-to-air models
- `evaluation.py` - Performance metrics and benchmarking

## Performance Targets
- **Detection accuracy**: >90% for drones at 100m+ distance
- **False positive rate**: <5% (critical for operational safety)
- **Inference speed**: <50ms per frame for real-time operation
- **Range**: Effective detection up to 500m

## Integration Points
- **Phase 3**: Model optimization for edge deployment
- **Phase 4**: RGB-thermal sensor fusion enhancement
- **Phase 5**: Multi-drone scenario validation
- **Phase 6**: Real-world UAV testing
