# Phase 2: Object Detection & Tracking

Progressive learning path from basic object detection to advanced air-to-air drone detection.

## Learning Progression

### 1. Basic Object Detection (`basic_object_detection/`)
**Foundation Skills:**
- YOLO family (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv10)
- R-CNN variants (Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN)
- Single-stage vs two-stage detectors
- Evaluation metrics (mAP, precision, recall)

**Hands-on Projects:**
- Train YOLO on COCO dataset
- Custom object detection pipeline
- Real-time detection with webcam
- Performance benchmarking

### 2. Drone Detection (`drone_detection/`)
**Specialized Skills:**
- Small object detection challenges
- Drone-specific datasets (VisDrone, etc.)
- Data augmentation for aerial objects
- Domain adaptation techniques

**Hands-on Projects:**
- Fine-tune models on drone datasets

- Compare detection algorithms for UAV targets

### 3. Air-to-Air Detection (`air_to_air_detection/`)
**Advanced Skills:**
- High-speed platform detection
- Multi-frame temporal consistency
- False positive reduction (birds vs drones)
- Real-time constraints for UAV platforms

**Hands-on Projects:**
- Implement air-to-air detection pipeline
